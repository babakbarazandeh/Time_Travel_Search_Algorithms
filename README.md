# Time_Travel_Search_Algorithms

## Project description

The goal in this project is to use AI search algorithms in the 3D space with some constratins. For every fixed z, the space is considered to be grid of points (x,y) that the the agent can move to one of the eight neighboring grid locations. Besides, there are some points in the space that let the agent to move bi-direcitally to the upper or lower layer. The program aims to reach from a given location to a target location with the optimal shortest path using only the channels that has been provided to it for changing the latitutde.
